# Rest Template Tutorial
The project is made of a client and server. Both client and server are implemented in Spring Boot.

## Server
Database: PostgreSQL
The database exposes a REST API

## Client
HTTP Client: RestTemplate
The client exposes a REST API itself after consuming the APIs from the server.
NB: CLient runs on port 8081
